This library contains Python/C++ bindigns for Verilator RTL simulator generator and for simulator binaries generated from it.


# Installation

## Linux (Ubuntu 19.10)

* `sudo apt install build-essential python3 cmake flex bison git libboost-dev libboost-all-dev`
* download [verilator](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing)
* apply patches from `verilator_patches_tmp` ( as it is done in [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Nic30/pycocotb/blob/master/.travis.yml#L50))
* install verilator
* run `sudo python3 setup.py install` to install globally or `python3 setup.py install --user` to install to `~/.local/...`
* Or if you want to just test this library without any kind of installation use `python3 setup.py build` to build c extensions.

## Windows

Using windows is not recomended with verilator. Asi it is more easy to use docker than tweak Verilator to run on Windows as desired.

* install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15) (C++)
* install [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* install [boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/more/getting_started/windows.html)
* install [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) and save installer `setup-x86_64.exe` to cygwin root.
* use `ci_scripts/appveyor_install.sh` to install this library and it's dependencies

After installation verilator has to run under cygwin, but python and this library are not restricted.
